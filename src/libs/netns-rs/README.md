# netns-rs

The netns-rs crate provides an ultra-simple interface for handling
network namespaces in Rust. Changing namespaces requires elevated
privileges, so in most cases this code needs to be run as root.

The implementation of this crate is inspired by the [netns(golang)](https://github.com/achanda/netns).
